# Proquizium

Welcome to Proquizium! 🎉

This awesome project was generated with the amazing [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.2.1.

## Development server

To start the development server, simply run `ng serve`. Then, open your favorite browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you make changes to the source files. How cool is that? 😎

## Code scaffolding

Need to generate a new component? No problem! Just run `ng generate component component-name`. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` to generate other awesome things.

## Build

Ready to build your project? Run `ng build` and watch the magic happen! The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. 🏗️

## Running unit tests

Time to test your code! Execute the unit tests by running `ng test` with the help of [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io). Let's make sure everything is working perfectly! 🧪
